Watch the YouTube video of the port to Xbox here:

After the video I made the following changes:
    1. Added Yavin's fog & near/far scene values
    2. Reduced Foliage
    3. changed loaded sound files to dag1 (AMAg_con)
    4. Added a 'Flower Power' conquest mission (using Dann Boeing's Pepperland Sides) + Trippy Soundtrack
    5. Changed the addon013.lvl to add a 'Flower power' icon.
    6. Added Load screen
    7. Reduced unit count (for better playability; Xbox can handle more units, but the battle gets crazy in that small area)
