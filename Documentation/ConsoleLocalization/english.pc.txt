ifs.freeform.tutorial.1="Galactic Conquest
(1/7) {OptionR}
The goal of Galactic Conquest is to construct fleets and navigate them through space as you attempt to conquer the galaxy, one planet at a time."
ifs.freeform.tutorial.10="Unit Availablility
{OptionL} (3/3)
The infantry and pilot classes are always available to select in planetary and space battles, respectively. Marines and pilots appear only in space, while all other classes are exclusive to planetary battles.
"
ifs.freeform.tutorial.11="Bonuses
(1/3) {OptionR} 
Bonuses are inexpensive, but expire after a single use. Up to three of any type can be stored for use, but only one can be used per battle. Browse bonuses with {btn_analog_l} and select with {btna}."
ifs.freeform.tutorial.12="Purchasing Bonuses
{OptionL} (2/3) {OptionR}
After choosing a bonus, apply it to one of three slots with {btna}. A bonus purchase can be cancelled with {btnb} only before the bonus is applied to a slot. Applying a new bonus to an occupied slot will overwrite the original bonus."
ifs.freeform.tutorial.13="Using Bonuses
{OptionL} (3/3)
Effects and costs of bonuses vary. Learn the best combat situations in which to use each bonus type, and try to keep multiple bonuses in your posession for use under unexpected circumstances."
ifs.freeform.tutorial.14="Galaxy Overview
(1/4) {OptionR}
The overview marks the end of your turn. After this, the enemy will have a chance to upgrade their army and move their fleet. Use this screen to review the status of your planets and fleets before moving on."
ifs.freeform.tutorial.15="Key Planets
{OptionL} (2/4) {OptionR}
Some planets are symbolically more important to each faction's cause than others. While their strategic values will vary, victory on these planets awards an extra reserve of credits to the winner."
ifs.freeform.tutorial.16="Base Planets
{OptionL} (3/4) {OptionR}
Each faction has a planet that serves as a base. The value of conquering and keeping this world is much higher than others. Conquering a base planet will render it neutral, crippling your enemy's credit income."
ifs.freeform.tutorial.17="Victory
{OptionL} (4/4)
Total conquest of the galaxy will always spell victory for your forces. Plan your strategies carefully and wipe out every enemy planet and fleet to achieve this goal."
ifs.freeform.tutorial.2="Navigating the Galaxy
{OptionL} (2/7) {OptionR}
Use {btn_analog_l} to navigate around the galaxy. {btnl2} and {btnr2} will zoom in and out, giving you close-up views of individual worlds or an all-encompassing galactic view for strategic planning."
ifs.freeform.tutorial.3="Planet Ownership
{OptionL} (3/7) {OptionR}
Blue stars represent planets under your control, while red represents planets under enemy control. Smaller white spots are always neutral and represent points in space that can be used to travel between worlds."
ifs.freeform.tutorial.4="Moving Fleets
{OptionL} (4/7) {OptionR}
Select a fleet with {btna}. When a fleet is selected, a dashed line will indicate its plotted course. Change the direction with {btn_analog_l} and move with {btna}. {btnb} will deselect the fleet in order to select another or explore the galaxy. "
ifs.freeform.tutorial.5="Constructing Fleets
{OptionL} (5/7) {OptionR}
Fleets can be constructed on planets you own with {btna}. The first fleet is always free, but the price will increase as more are deployed. A fleet must be moved from a planet before another can be constructed."
ifs.freeform.tutorial.6="Earning Credits
{OptionL} (6/7) {OptionR}
Credits are awarded to each side after battle. Planetary battles are worth more than space, the amount varying by planet. Credits are also awarded after planetary battles based on how many planets you own."
ifs.freeform.tutorial.7="Upgrades
{OptionL} (7/7)
Credits can be used to build additional fleets, purchase bonuses and recruit additional unit types, augmenting your forces in battle. Before moving, try accessing these screens with {btnl1} or {btnr1}."
ifs.freeform.tutorial.8="Unit Classes
(1/3) {OptionR}
New unit types can be recruited as a permanent addition to your forces in battle. These units will be selectable by your entire team in battle. Browse unit types with {btn_analog_l} and recruit with {btna}."
ifs.freeform.tutorial.9="Recruiting Units
{OptionL} (2/3) {OptionR}
Units that have not been recruited are shadowed and labeled in color. Yellow indicates that the cost of recruitment falls within your means, while units marked in red exceed your resource limit."

SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE has commissioned an elite division of clone troopers, the 501st LEGION, to vanquish the Separatist threat once and for all.  Their unwavering loyalty to the Chancellor, combined with the Republic's desperation to see an end to the war, has set the stage for the execution of Palpatine's ultimate plan.

Needless to say, this got the men of the 501st a little hot under the helmet, and not just because of all the lava.
