'xbox_ps2_Build_findings.txt' -- My thoughts as I was trying to understand the 
	level of support the 'munge' process had for the Xbox version.

'xbox_ps2_setup.bat' -- A setup file to be run at 'C:\BF2_ModTools\data_<myData>\_BUILD'.
	It creates some simple batch files to be used in the build process & adds copies
	and renames some '.exe' files for the xbox munge process.
