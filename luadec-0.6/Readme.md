Doesn't work 100% of the time.

The code was taken from the 0.6 version.

Looks like it targets Lua 5.0.2.

In the initial commit, I have made very little code changes.
I have made some file structure changes though.

Hopefully making it a VC++ project will make it easier to debug.

I have left the original 'Makefile's, 'COPYRIGHT'  and 'readme's in place.
Since the structure has changed, this project may not build on linux structured like this.
If you want to build on linux, use the link above and download the original project.
